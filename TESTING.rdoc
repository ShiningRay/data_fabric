data_fabric has two layers of tests: unit tests and integration tests.


== Running the Unit Tests

The unit tests test both with and without an actual database.  test/database_test.rb
tests against a database.  The other unit tests mock AR so no actual database is 
required.  You can use the standard test/database.yml which tests against SQLite3
or customize the provided test/database.yml.mysql.  The "rake create_db" task will
set up the necessary databases and tables.


== Running the Integration Tests

data_fabric ships with an example application which shows an actual Rails application
using data_fabric.  You can customize config/database.yml but by default it uses a local
Sqlite3 database so there should be no customization necessary.

Run the Rake task to prepare the application for testing.  This will delete existing SQLite
databases and migrate all the databases from scratch.  You should then be able to run the
example application's tests.

 cd example
 rake app:prepare
 rake test
